## Notes
â„¹ Even though it's built with PHP in mind and has some built in opinionated cmds (`run-laravel-route-cache`) you can use this to run basically any command in any container you need to by using the `custom-cmds` and passing any container you need through `docker-image`

### Example of step configuration and usage:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run commands'
    uses: adore-me/gha-run-cmds@master
    with:
      docker-image: SOME_DOCKER_IMAGE
      run-laravel-route-cache: true
      custom-cmds: |
        php artisan config:cache
        php artisan route:list
        ls -la
```
